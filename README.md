# 2048

A simple ncurses implementation of the game 2048

It saves your game when you 'q'uit, loads it when you run the game.

There is no game over detection, and I will make some improvements...

## Playing

Press any of the arrow keys **twice** to make a move. This was the way
I found not to have the move triggered multiple times.

Press 'q' to quit.
Press 'n' to start a new game.
